# OutRun Online Arcade Recompiled

Static recompilation of **OutRun Online Arcade** (Xbox 360 XBLA, SEGA / Sumo Digital, 2009; Title ID 58410968, default.xex 0.0.1.5 built 2009-04-03) to native Windows, using the [ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk) v0.9.0.

**No game data is included.** You need your own OutRun Online Arcade XBLA package (the Xbox 360 LIVE file from your
console's storage).

## Download
Get the latest `outrun_arcade-<version>-win-amd64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/darkuni/outrun-arcade-recomp/releases),
unzip it, put your package file (or the `58410968` folder copied from the console) in the same folder and run
`outrun_arcade.exe`: the first start makes the `assets` folder from it. Nothing else to install. Requirements: 64-bit Windows 10/11 and the
[Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022 (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

## Building
GitHub Actions builds on every push to `main` (or run **Build Windows** by hand from the Actions tab); publishing a
release (or pushing a `v*` tag) attaches the zip to it. Unzip a build and put your extracted game files in an `assets`
folder next to the exe (`tools/stfs_extract.py <package> assets` extracts the package):

```
outrun_arcade.exe
*.dll
assets\
  default.xex
  ...
```

## In-game settings (F1 or Esc)
Same menu as the Poker Smash / ReBirth recomps: display mode (also F11), window size, render resolution, VSync, aspect ratio, texture filtering, audio buffer, keyboard on/off, per-button key rebinding, quit. Saved to `outrun_arcade.toml` next to the exe. F3 = performance overlay. Runs as the full game.

### Default keyboard layout
| Action | Controller | Key |
|---|---|---|
| Steer | Left stick | Left / Right |
| Accelerate | RT (+ stick up) | Up |
| Brake | LT (+ stick down) | Down |
| A / B / X / Y | A / B / X / Y | Z / X / A / S |
| LB / RB | LB / RB | Q / W |
| D-pad | D-pad | I / J / K / L |
| Start / Back | Start / Back | Enter / Backspace |

## Layout
| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `outrun_arcade_manifest.toml` | ReXGlue project manifest (codegen input) |
| `outrun_arcade_overrides.toml` | Pointer-only functions |
| `src/title_exit.cpp` | Exit from the game's own menu closes the window (was a hang) |
| `generated/` | Recompiled C++ output of `rexglue codegen` |
| `src/outrun_arcade_app.h` | App class - game folder default, Xenos GPU plugin, full-game license, first-launch defaults, menu/F11 binds |
| `src/game_menu.*`, `src/game_keys.h` | F1/Esc settings menu and this game's key layout |
| `tools/` | Package/XEX extraction (STFS, XEX2 basic + LZX), pointer-function scan, label check |
| `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml` | CI: LLVM + SDK (cached) + game, uploads exe + DLLs |

## Codegen fixes so far
- No analysis errors on the first pass.
- 44 functions reachable only through vtables/callbacks (`tools/scan_pointer_funcs.py`).

## Audio fixes
- **Engine pops** (SDK p22+, `xma_start_latency_us`, default 6000): a freshly
  started XMA voice gets its first audio a few ms late, like the 360's
  hardware decoder. The game starts engine voices loud and turns them down a
  frame later; with instant decode that first loud frame was audible as a pop.
- **Song-title callout cut off** (`src/callout_hold.cpp`,
  `outrun_callout_hold_ms`, default 1000): after the song pick the front end
  waits (state 62) for 75 loads, then stops all menu voices. Loads finish far
  faster than on a 360, which cut the callout mid-word; the wait is held for
  at least 1 s. `outrun_callout_trace = true` logs it to callout_trace.txt.
- **Single Player confirm sound cut off** (`src/voice_hooks.cpp`,
  `outrun_keep_confirm`, default on): the game-mode task's init stops every
  sound 16 frames after the pick; on a 360 the confirm sound survives that
  stop (measured from real hardware). Stops from that init path skip voices
  started in the last 600 ms. `outrun_voice_trace = true` writes
  voice_api_trace.txt (every voice call, with callers).

## Other fixes
- **Quit from the game's menu hung** (`src/title_exit.cpp`): the game exits through XLaunchNewImage
  (XamLoaderLaunchTitle, back to the dashboard on a 360). The SDK terminated the title but the window only closes
  when the game's main thread ends, which it didn't, so the game froze after saving. The exit now closes the
  window like the close button does.

## Diagnostics
- Crash reporter: `crash-*.txt` + `.dmp` next to the exe; decode offsets with
  `outrun_arcade.map` (shipped in the build).
- SDK: `xma_trace`, `audio_dump`, `xma_dump`, `xma_mute`/`xma_solo` (clip
  names from `xma_clips.txt`).
- `tools/diagnostics/voice_trace.cpp` (not built): logs who destroys a voice.
