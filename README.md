# OutRun Online Arcade Recompiled

Static recompilation of **OutRun Online Arcade** (Xbox 360 XBLA, SEGA / Sumo Digital, 2009; Title ID 58410968, default.xex 0.0.1.5 built 2009-04-03) to native Windows and Linux (Vulkan), using the [ReXGlue SDK](https://github.com/rexglue/rexglue-sdk) v0.9.0.

**No game data is included.** You need your own OutRun Online Arcade XBLA package (the Xbox 360 LIVE file from your
console's storage).

## Download
Get the latest `outrun_arcade-<version>-win-amd64.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/darkuni/outrun-arcade-recomp/releases),
unzip it, put your package file (or the `58410968` folder copied from the console) in the same folder and run
`outrun_arcade.exe`: the first start makes the `assets` folder from it. Nothing else to install. Requirements: 64-bit Windows 10/11 and the
[Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022 (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

## Building
GitHub Actions builds on every push to `main` (or run **Build Windows** by hand from the Actions tab); publishing a
release (or pushing a `v*` tag) attaches the zip to it. Unzip a build and put your extracted game files in an `assets`
folder next to the exe (`tools/stfs_extract.py <package> assets` extracts the package):

```
outrun_arcade.exe
*.dll
assets\
  default.xex
  ...
```

## Linux (native, Vulkan)
The same recompiled code builds as a native Linux executable. On Linux the SDK's Xenos GPU plugin is
Vulkan-only (D3D12 is compiled out), so nothing needs picking: the game renders through Vulkan. No Wine/Proton.

**Status:** builds with no source changes to the recompiled code; boots, extracts the package on first start
and plays with correct graphics and sound; saving and loading work.
Tested on CachyOS (Arch), clang 22, AMD Radeon
8060S (RADV, Mesa), KDE Plasma Wayland (through Xwayland). Not yet tested: NVIDIA, Steam Deck native, full
playthroughs.

### Build
Needs clang 20+, CMake 3.25+, Ninja, git, and the SDK's system libraries:

| Distro | Packages |
|---|---|
| Arch / CachyOS | `clang cmake ninja git gtk3 libx11 libxcb libxss vulkan-icd-loader alsa-lib libpulse pipewire` |
| Ubuntu 24.04 | clang-20 (apt.llvm.org), `cmake ninja-build build-essential git libgtk-3-dev libx11-xcb-dev libxss-dev libvulkan-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev libpipewire-0.3-dev` |

```
tools/build_linux.sh            # SDK v0.9.0 + darkuni SDK patches, then the game
```
The first run clones and builds the ReXGlue SDK (v0.9.0 plus the same `rexglue-sdk-builds` patches as the
Windows package) into `out/linux-deps/` - about 20-30 min; later runs only rebuild the game. Pass another
folder as the first argument to keep the SDK elsewhere; `CC`/`CXX`/`JOBS` are honoured. GitHub Actions does the
same on Ubuntu (`.github/workflows/build-linux.yml`) and uploads `outrun_arcade-linux-amd64.tar.gz`.

### Run
```
dist-linux/
  outrun_arcade
  librexruntime.so
  librexgpu-xenos.so
  37517779402B5BE6177926168277F003FFE29D83   <- your package (or the 58410968 folder)
```
Put your package next to `outrun_arcade` and start it; the first start makes `assets/` from it, as on Windows.
The folder runs from anywhere (libraries load from next to the executable). Settings go to `outrun_arcade.toml`,
logs to `logs/`.

### Linux notes
- **X11 / Xwayland:** the SDK forces SDL's X11 video driver (its Vulkan presenter uses `VK_KHR_xcb_surface`), so
  on Wayland desktops it runs through Xwayland. Starting it from a plain TTY/SSH shell needs `DISPLAY` (and
  `XAUTHORITY`) from your desktop session.
- **Crashes:** no `crash-*.txt` writer on Linux. The SDK owns SIGSEGV/SIGILL (guest MMIO traps and SEH
  emulation), and a handler of ours would get in their way; unhandled faults end in a normal core dump instead:
  `coredumpctl gdb outrun_arcade`, with `outrun_arcade.map` for recompiled function names.
- **Quitting:** use F1 > Quit or the window close button. The process does not exit on SIGTERM
  (`kill`/`timeout`); use `pkill -KILL outrun_arcade` from a shell.
- **Saves (SDK fix):** `patches/sdk/0001-posix-file-access-mode.patch` backports rexglue-sdk commit
  `0bd1fd552` (after v0.9.0). Without it the POSIX file layer opened read+write files write-only
  (`O_RDONLY | O_WRONLY` = `O_WRONLY`), so loading the save failed with "end of file" and the game reported its
  save data as damaged. Windows was never affected. `tools/build_linux.sh` applies `patches/sdk/` after the
  rexglue-sdk-builds patches; drop it when moving to an SDK release that includes the fix.
- **GPU choice:** with more than one Vulkan device, set `vulkan_device` (index, listed in the log) in
  `outrun_arcade.toml`.

## In-game settings (F1 or Esc)
Same menu as the Poker Smash / ReBirth recomps: display mode (also F11), window size, render resolution, VSync, aspect ratio, texture filtering, audio buffer, keyboard on/off, per-button key rebinding, quit. Saved to `outrun_arcade.toml` next to the exe. F3 = performance overlay. Runs as the full game.

### Default keyboard layout
| Action | Controller | Key |
|---|---|---|
| Steer | Left stick | Left / Right |
| Accelerate | RT (+ stick up) | Up |
| Brake | LT (+ stick down) | Down |
| A / B / X / Y | A / B / X / Y | Z / X / A / S |
| LB / RB | LB / RB | Q / W |
| D-pad | D-pad | I / J / K / L |
| Start / Back | Start / Back | Enter / Backspace |

## Layout
| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `outrun_arcade_manifest.toml` | ReXGlue project manifest (codegen input) |
| `outrun_arcade_overrides.toml` | Pointer-only functions |
| `generated/` | Recompiled C++ output of `rexglue codegen` |
| `src/outrun_arcade_app.h` | App class - game folder default, Xenos GPU plugin, full-game license, first-launch defaults, menu/F11 binds |
| `src/game_menu.*`, `src/game_keys.h` | F1/Esc settings menu and this game's key layout |
| `tools/` | Package/XEX extraction (STFS, XEX2 basic + LZX), pointer-function scan, label check |
| `.github/workflows/build-windows.yml` | CI: LLVM + SDK (cached) + game, uploads exe + DLLs |
| `tools/build_linux.sh`, `.github/workflows/build-linux.yml` | Linux: SDK + patches + game, staged in `dist-linux/` |
| `patches/sdk/` | SDK fixes backported to the pinned v0.9.0 (applied by `tools/build_linux.sh`) |

## Codegen fixes so far
- No analysis errors on the first pass.
- 44 functions reachable only through vtables/callbacks (`tools/scan_pointer_funcs.py`).

## Audio fixes
- **Engine pops** (SDK p22+, `xma_start_latency_us`, default 6000): a freshly
  started XMA voice gets its first audio a few ms late, like the 360's
  hardware decoder. The game starts engine voices loud and turns them down a
  frame later; with instant decode that first loud frame was audible as a pop.
- **Song-title callout cut off** (`src/callout_hold.cpp`,
  `outrun_callout_hold_ms`, default 1000): after the song pick the front end
  waits (state 62) for 75 loads, then stops all menu voices. Loads finish far
  faster than on a 360, which cut the callout mid-word; the wait is held for
  at least 1 s. `outrun_callout_trace = true` logs it to callout_trace.txt.
- **Single Player confirm sound cut off** (`src/voice_hooks.cpp`,
  `outrun_keep_confirm`, default on): the game-mode task's init stops every
  sound 16 frames after the pick; on a 360 the confirm sound survives that
  stop (measured from real hardware). Stops from that init path skip voices
  started in the last 600 ms. `outrun_voice_trace = true` writes
  voice_api_trace.txt (every voice call, with callers).

## Diagnostics
- Crash reporter: `crash-*.txt` + `.dmp` next to the exe; decode offsets with
  `outrun_arcade.map` (shipped in the build).
- SDK: `xma_trace`, `audio_dump`, `xma_dump`, `xma_mute`/`xma_solo` (clip
  names from `xma_clips.txt`).
- `tools/diagnostics/voice_trace.cpp` (not built): logs who destroys a voice.
